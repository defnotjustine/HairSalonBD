# Hair Salon Database System

This is a database-driven application designed for managing a hair salon. It stores detailed information about employees, including their names, phone numbers, available and booked appointment slots, areas of specialization, and years of experience. The system also manages customer information, such as gender, name, phone number (used as a unique identifier), and records of past treatments.

Customers can easily search for available appointment dates and services based on their preferences, such as treatment type and specific employee, and make reservations directly through the system. Additionally, they can view their past bookings.
